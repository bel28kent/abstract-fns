# Some useful abstract functions in the Racket language

This repository contains functions in [Racket](docs.racket-lang.org).
These functions are abstractions of repetitive procedures, such as asking
if a boolean value is `true?` or passing a single value to multiple
procedures (`valmap`).

This repository is necessary for the [hum-parser](https://github.com/bel28kent/hum-parser)
codebase.
